1) Solar Panel
- remain the cell Type unchanged
- Wattage: range from 0W to 900W, each increment is 5W
- Efficiency: range from 5% to 30%, each increment is 0.1%

2) Inverter
- remain inverter type unchanged
- Power Rating: range from 0.1kW to 5000, each increment is 0.1kW
- Phases: two options only  which is single phase or three phase
- MPPTs: range from 2 to 12, each increment is 1
- Efficiency: range from 90% to 99%, each increment is 0.1%

3) Battery
- Battery Type: changed to Lead-Acid, Lithium-Ion, AGM, Other
- Capacity: 50Ah to 20000Ah, each increment is 50Ah
- Voltage: 12V to 1500V, each increment is 2V 
- Cycle Life: 500 to 7000, each increment is 500

I want to add a few categories:
1) Mounting Structure
- Mounting Type: Roof-Mounted, Ground-Mounted, Pole-Mounted, Portable, Tracker
- Material: Aluminum, Steel (Galvanized), Stainless Steel, Plastic
- Resistance: Wind, Snow, Salt

2) Cable 
- Voltage Rating: 100V to 1500V, each increment is 100V
- Current Capacity:10A to 400A, each increment is 10A
- Wire Gauge: options: 2.5, 4, 6, 10, 16, 25, 35, 50, 70, 95, 120, 150, 185, 240
- Insulation Type: PV Wire, THHN/THWN, XLPE

3) Others
DC Fuse, DC MCB, DC SPD, DC DB, AC Fuse, AC MCB, AC SPD, AC DB, MCCB, Ground Fault, Switch, Arc Fault.
